tracestats.py calculates mean and stddev on multiple windows
xbootmgr trace runs.

.xml files in the current directory are treated as being from the same series
of runs and mean and stddev of the duration are calculated on the intervals in
them. These XML files are generated via "xperf -i boot_x.etl -o boot_x.xml -a
boot"
